# Git Repository for date to units converter

This webpage is used strictly for accepting two dates: **start** and **end**, and representing the duration between the dates as weeks, months, or days. Finally, based on the frequency of **hrs/week**, **hrs/month**, or **hrs/day**, it calculates how many billable units the frequency over that duration contains.

This conversion tool can be used for social workers in order to quickly calculate the units for services that are set up for the client through insurance, wavered programs, or etc.
